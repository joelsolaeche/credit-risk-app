_**Assistant**_

The error message:

```
error: remote origin already exists.
```

means that your git repository already has a remote named `origin`. You cannot add another remote with the same name unless you remove or change the existing one.

**To fix this:**

1. **Check your current remotes:**
   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```
   This will show you the current remote(s) and their URLs.

2. **If you want to change the URL for `origin`:**
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/joelsolaeche/credit-risk-app.git
   ```
   This updates the existing `origin` remote to the new URL.

3. **If you want to remove and re-add the remote:**
   ```sh
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/joelsolaeche/credit-risk-app.git
   ```

**Recommendation:**  
Usually, just updating the URL with `git remote set-url origin ...` is the simplest and safest way.

Would you like me to propose the exact command for you to run?
