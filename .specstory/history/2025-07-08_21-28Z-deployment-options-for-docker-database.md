<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to look at their database and suggest deployments for the web. They mentioned they were thinking about Vercel but since it's via Docker, they're not sure what to choose. 

Looking at the project layout, I can see this is a credit risk project with:
- A Flask app in `src/app/`
- Docker files (Dockerfile in `src/app/` and `src/models/`)
- A docker-compose.yml file
- Templates and static files for a web interface

I should first examine the database setup and the app structure to understand what kind of database they're using and how the application is structured. Then I can provide deployment recommendations.

Let me start by looking at the database configuration and app structure.</details></think>

I'll help you analyze your database setup and suggest deployment options for your credit risk application. Let me first examine your database configuration and app structure.

Read file: src/app/database.py

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see that the database is just a simple dictionary for user authentication. This is a basic in-memory data structure, not a real database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB. Let me also check the app.py file to understand the overall structure and requirements.</details></think>
